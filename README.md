# Welcome to nPower!

## Overview
This is yet another project in the works.
The nPower core is a 32-bit PowerPC subset compatible core. It can run most common instructions but leaves out some of the features like segmentation and virtual memory.
The core is a superpipelined in-order dual issue superscalar core.

## Features
* Dual pipelines
* 8kB 4-way associative instruction cache
* perceptron branch prediction
* single channel to memory

## Reset
On reset the core vectors to $FFFC0000 which is where the system ROM is located, rather than to address $00000100.

## Memory

### Alignment
All access for instructions and data is little-endian. There are no alignment restrictions on data, the core will
run two bus cycles if necessary for unaligned data.

### Interface
The external data bus is 128-bit to facilitate cache loads. The core has a single bus to fetch and store instructions and data.

### Caches
The core has a 8kB 4-way associative instruction cache which can supply two instructions for every machine cycle.
There is currently no data cache.

## Status
Work began on this core about December 5th, 2020. It is still in its early stages and has many issues to fix.

# Top Module
nPower.sv is the top module.
There are a couple of other scratch files in the repository.
